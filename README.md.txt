Marker Posts Location Information

Data originated from Highways England Gazetteer Database. Data is accurate to September 2017.
Original Location information was provided in OSGR Eastings and Northings. Unfortunately Google Maps services do not take OSGR location reference but only in WGS84.

Hence the "gaz" Colab / Jupyter Notebook was compiled with the necessary python code to convert OSGR to WGS84. 

Marker Posts Location Information was extracted from the database and hosted on Google Fusion Table. These Marker Posts cover the entirety of the Highways England Strategic Road Network. 
By quoting these Marker Posts information in a breakdown scenario will enable the recovery organisation to reach your location easily.
